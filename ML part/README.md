# Vanilla Application

This README provides instructions for running the Vanilla application components.

## Components

The Vanilla application consists of two main components:

1. A command-line application for growth prediction
2. A web interface built with Streamlit

## Running the Command Line Application

To run the growth prediction command-line application:

```
python vanilla-growth-prediction-fixed.py
```

This will execute the command-line interface for making growth predictions.

## Running the Web Interface

To run the application with the Streamlit web interface:

```

```

This command will start the Streamlit server and open the web interface in your default browser.
